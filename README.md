Practical PACE tutorials

Welcome friend! Herein lies a bunch of NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) tutorials for funzies. It's probably the first time in my scientific programming career that I was thoughful about external interpretation/use of my code. I'm not saying I'm great at it, but hey, it's a start :-)

I hope you find these tutorials useful. Here's a few things it will help you do: 

> 1. Propagate surface light to any depth using PACE's full spectral Kd terms (now including UV)
> 2. Create Optical Water Mass classifications using hyperspectral data per [Wei et al. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442572200339X)
> 3. Create maps and time-series of phytoplankton community composition from [MOANA](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/apt/documents/moana/v1.0)
> 4. Create hyperspectral correlation matrices using in situ data from the [GLORIA dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01973-y)
> 5. Learn to use and interpret the [Quality Water Index Polynomial](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/remote-sensing/articles/10.3389/frsen.2022.869611/full) (QWIP) for validation matchups
> 6. Visualize/extract hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance spectra across a customized transect
> 7. Interactively enhance true color images and dynamically adjust input wavelengths
